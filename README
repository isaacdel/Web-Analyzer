I. File list
------------
DataExtractor.java              The data getter class that collects data and picks the top topics
NameExtractor.java              Extract names phrases from a sentence using OpenNLP
NounExtractor.java              Extract noun phrases from a sentence using OpenNLP

pom.xml                         Maven dependencies

II. Design
----------
A. Program design

The program is handled by the Assignment class - it reads the HTML file into a document and then calls on the execution
and receives the results from DataExtractor upon the read document.
DataExtractor read significant and important tags that could hold important and relevant info about the page such as
the titles and meta tags and stores it in an object named SiteData.
NounExtractor and NameExtractor receive strings from DataExtractor and they extract nouns and names from these
strings using OpenNlp.
DataExtractor calculates which ones appear most. The top results are sent back as a List of strings to Assignment where
they are displayed.
The design is expandable as we can add more OpenNlp libraries (any type and in any language) to the resources file
in order to get different results.

III. How to run the code
------------------------------
In main project folder (where pom.xml file is) run:

mvn clean compile assembly:single
cd target/
java -jar Assignment-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar "http://www.XXXX.XXX"


Where "http://www.XXXX.XXX" can be any URL.

IV. Known issues
